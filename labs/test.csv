- The custom getopts code was a bit difficult to work with, especially
when working on multi-level subcommands, which is needed for
multi-vendor export functionnality. Using clap will make this easy.

- Because Travis no longer processes open source CI for free, Rooster's
CI was no longer working. Moving to Github Actions seems easiest.

- The weak command was unusable in practice because some websites
require weak passwords for whatever reason.

- The uninstall command was out of date. When installing Rooster with a
package manager, it was suggesting bad uninstall commands.
